</p>

## ðŸ”§ Features

-  **Modpack management**: Say goodbye to manual downloads and installations.
-  **Seamless server joining**: Connect to your favorite modded servers with a single click.
- **Auto-updating**: Every time you press play, Modifi automatically updates your mods to match the server. 
-  **Automatic Optimization**: Tailored configurations for your hardware.

## ðŸš§ Limitations and Future Development

Modifi is in active development and as of yet, it has not been officially released.

As we move forward, we plan to roll out support for servers on an invite-only basis. For the alpha release of Modifi, the automatic mod updates and seamless server joining features will be exclusive to the Thealater servers.

We understand that many server owners may be interested in Modifi's capabilities. While we're eager to expand our support for more servers, we want to ensure a high-quality experience for all players. Therefore, expanding our server support will be a gradual process.

If you're a server owner and interested in Modifi, we would love to hear from you! Please feel free to reach out to us at [thealater@gmail.com](mailto:thealater@gmail.com). 

We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to improve and expand the functionality of Modifi.
